Simple html/javascript clicker game.

Multiple counters attached to buttons. Feed, clean, pet, train.
Adorable Puppies counters are fixed values. All others are randomly generated.
Counters drain 1 per second. Clicking fills.
On click the current numer of the counter is added to a total. If total hits a number pet dies.

Every 30 seconds a new pet is added.

To prevent user leaving early have a loading bar for the 30 seconds titled "Getting bored with [latest pet]"

When a pet dies show IP and declare that its been forwarded to PETA.

If survive 10 minutes put up a message saying user clearly plays too many video games to properly care for pets and that PETA has been notified.

If pet kills you show similar notice but note that PETA would probably approve.

If get randomly generated hamster, second hamster immediately added. Cant only have one!
